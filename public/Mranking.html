<h2>Novels </h2>
<h3>The Shiva trilogy</h3>
<p>
    <h4>Part 1, Part2, Part3</h4>
    I have read all the three parts. Its an awesome piece
    of work.Its keeps one engaged and has avery enchanting
    story line.
</p>
<h3>Ram Chandra Series</h3>
<p>I have read 4 parts of the book by the same author 
    .Its amazing and represents the story through the 
    aspect of each of the leading characters.
</p>
<p>Each book is dedicated to each of the main characters.
    And the forth book combines the three characters and
    continues the remaining story.
</p>
<h3>The Alchemist, Power of Subconscious mind</h3>
<p> These are very positive books, filled with goodness.</p>
<h3>The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari</h3>
<h4>This is my favourite</h4>
<p>This book is all the peace that one will need in life.
    Might seem boring but gives all toghther a diiferent
    insights.If you are a book lover like me then its 
    definitely something you should consider reading.
